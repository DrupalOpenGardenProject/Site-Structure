This is the main project file architecture that we will all share. We will try to not update the structure very much.

Installation:
* Check out Drupal 6 git mirror and put in this folder.
git clone frome here: http://github.com/drupal/drupal.git   (branch drupal-6)
http://github.com/drupal/drupal/tree/DRUPAL-6

* Check out sites from github
git clone from here: 

* Make a symbolic link in d6 and connect it to the 'sites' folder

* In Mysql, make a local database for your drupal 6 site, for the managing news site, and any other database you might need.

* Set up the settings.php files to point to all the appropriate databases.

* Obtain a fresh copy of our database (you will receive a login/password & instructions on how to do this.)
