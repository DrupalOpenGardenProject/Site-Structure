This is the main project file architecture that we will all share. We will try to not update the structure very much.

What to do with this repository:
GitHub is hosting these files so we can all obtain them to run on our local machines.

You will want to 'clone' this entire repository.
'clone' is a git command, which will download this entire repository and all its history.
You will need to have installed git on your computer to run git clone.

To install, we recommend that you navigate into your webservers public documents folder.
On MAMP/XAMP/WAMP/LAMP - this is usually htdocs.

Basically, you want to clone this whole repository into your webserver folder.

git clone http://github.com/DrupalOpenGardenProject/Site-Structure.git

This will download a bunch of files, and create a new folder called Site-Structure.

Next, you will probably want to get your drupal files.
See the README.txt in d6/README.txt


Overview of components:

1. d6/ a place to put Drupal 6 core files
Since we are all sharing a system, it is easier if the system we share has a similar set up.
For this reason, we have a placeholder for your core Drupal files.
A Drupal site contains: core Drupal files, sites folder with settings.php, database

How to get Drupal using the git mirror: 
* Instructions in the d6 folder.
* Git is configured to ignore the 'drupal' folder generated by the git clone.

How to get Drupal source files the easy way:
Download the latest version of Drupal (6.19) from drupal.org.
Make sure the folder containing the Drupal files is called drupal
(which you will put in d6/, so it will be d6/drupal) - if you call it something else
you will need to change your .gitignore file so you won't commit the whole Drupal 
codebase to our git repository. We don't want 5 people committing different installations of Drupal.
That's too much file space & Drupal is already going to be the same for all of us if we download the
same codebase.

2. James' version of Managing News
* Instructions for installing Managing News are in mn folder.
* Git is configured to ignore the managing news folder.

3. Sites folder
* These are all the modules & themes & subsites that we are using so build various websites. 
* The sites folder is connected to the d6/drupal folder through a symbolic link.
* You will need to set up the symbolic link in your d6/drupal folder. Instructions are at d6/README.txt
