This is the main project file architecture that we will all share. We will try to not update the structure very much.

Overview of components:

1. d6/ a place to put Drupal 6 core files
Since we are all sharing a system, it is easier if the system we share has a similar set up.
For this reason, we have a placeholder for your core Drupal files.
A Drupal site contains: core Drupal files, sites folder with settings.php, database

How to get Drupal using the git mirror: 
* Instructions in the d6 folder.
* Git is configured to ignore the 'drupal' folder generated by the git clone.

How to get Drupal source files the easy way:
Download the latest version of Drupal (6.19) from drupal.org.
Make sure the folder containing the Drupal files is called drupal
(which you will put in d6/, so it will be d6/drupal) - if you call it something else
you will need to change your .gitignore file so you won't commit the whole Drupal 
codebase to our git repository. We don't want 5 people committing different installations of Drupal.
That's too much file space & Drupal is already going to be the same for all of us if we download the
same codebase.

2. James' version of Managing News
* Instructions for installing Managing News are in mn folder.
* Git is configured to ignore the managing news folder.

3. Sites folder
* These are all the modules & themes & subsites that we are using so build various websites. 
* The sites folder is connected to the d6/drupal folder through a symbolic link.
* You will need to set up the symbolic link in your d6/drupal folder. Instructions are at d6/README.txt
