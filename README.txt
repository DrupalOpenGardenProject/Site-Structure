This is the main project file architecture that we will all share. We will try to not update the structure very much.

Installation: 
1. Check out Drupal 6 git mirror 
* Instructions in the d6 folder.
* Git is configured to ignore the 'drupal' folder generated by the git clone.

2. Check out James' version of Managing News
* Instructions will be in mn folder.
* Git will be configured to ignore the managing news folder.

3. Sites folder
* The sites folder is connected to the d6/drupal folder through a symbolic link.
* You may need to test that it worked depending on your system.


* Make a symbolic link in d6 and connect it to the 'sites' folder

* In Mysql, make a local database for your drupal 6 site, for the managing news site, and any other database you might need.

* Set up the settings.php files to point to all the appropriate databases.

* Obtain a fresh copy of our database (you will receive a login/password & instructions on how to do this.)
