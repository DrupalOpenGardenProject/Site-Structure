<p>The Table Wizard facilitates dealing with database tables:</p>

<ul>
<li>It allows surfacing any table in the Drupal default database through Views 2.</li>
<li>Relationships between the tables it manages can be defined, so views combining data in the tables can be constructed.</li>
<li>It performs analysis of the tables it manages, reporting on empty fields, data ranges, ranges of string lengths, etc.</li>
<li>It provides an API for other modules to views-enable their tables.</li>
<li>It provides an API for importing data into tables in the Drupal default database (automatically doing the views integration above).</li>
<li>It is bundled with an implementation of this API, for importing comma- and tab-delimited files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Applications of Table Wizard include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Module developers can use Table Wizard to views-enable their data tables without writing their own Views hook.</li>
<li>Developers and administrators can use Table Wizard to create views of all tables in the database, whether or not their creators provided Views integration.</li>
<li>Users could upload spreadsheets and apply Views to them.</li>
</ul>
