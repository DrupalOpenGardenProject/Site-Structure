<p>To add existing tables in your Drupal default database to the Table Wizard, go to 
<a href="&base_url&admin/content/tw">Content management => Table Wizard</a>, expand 
<b>Add existing tables</b>, and 
choose one or more tables to add. Once added, a table can be used as the base for a view, 
and a default view of the table is provided (click on the table name in the list). The
Analyze page for a table gives you information on the contents of the table (identifying 
empty fields, data ranges, etc.) and allows you to identify fields which can be used to 
join to other tables. You can Reanalyze tables if their contents have changed.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="&base_url&admin/content/tw/relationships">Content management => 
Table Wizard => Relationships</a> to create relationships 
among the tables you've added to Table Wizard. When you create a relationships between, say,
ExampleTbl1.key and ExampleTbl2.key, then in a view containing ExampleTbl1 you can add a 
relationship to ExampleTbl2, and bring fields from that table into the view.</p>

<p>External comma-separated and tab-delimited files can be imported into the default Drupal 
database using the provided tw_import_delimited module. After enabling this module,
the Table Wizard page has an additional fieldset, Upload delimited files. When you import 
a file, it is automatically added to the Table Wizard and analyzed.</p>
