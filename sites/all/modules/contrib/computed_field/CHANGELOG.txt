  data type is text or longtext as per http://drupal.org/node/141340
* Added callbacks to hook_field_settings as per http://drupal.org/node/87619

* Deleted license in favour of LICENSE.txt

27th November 2006
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Updated to work with 5.0 cvs. Thanks bdragon.

29th September 2006
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed validation of data length
* Made non-stored computed fields compute on load, rather than view.

15th September 2006
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Made default output the raw text, rather than running check_markup over it

12th September 2006
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Moved code, display, and display format from widget to field
* Added hook_field_formatter_info and hook_field_formatter, and filters op in
  hook_field to work properly with new views

17th August 2006
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Changed computed_field_field_view_item to computed_field_view_item so that
  it works with views

11th August 2006
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Changed display format so that you can enter arbitrary code to display the
  field
* Made display format code run even when there isn't any computed code
* Stored fields are now computed at insert time, rather than submit time. This
  means that other fields will have more useful values, since they have
  already been processed by their widgets.

7th August 2006
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Made $node editable by computed code

3rd August 2006
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Removed a call to check_plain which was more annoying than useful.
* Changed the field to be computed on submit so that the value can be stored
  in the database. A consequence of this is that it won't work on preview, but
  at least now it is only computed once (per submit).
* Made computed fields visible in views
* Changed the value you need to set in your code from $node_field['value'] to
  $node_field[0]['value] so that multiple values can be used.

21st July 2006
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Initial Release
