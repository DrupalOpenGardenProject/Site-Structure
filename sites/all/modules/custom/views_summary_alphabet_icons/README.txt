This is a module being developed in conjunction with the Drupal Open Garden Project, Summer 2010.

There are several people who will work on the plugin, mainly focusing on learning themeing, CSS & PHP.

This module is a 'Views Style' Plugin.

It will add alphabet icon sets to a Views summary.


8/3/2010
A few of us will be meeting to look at the views style plugin. 
We will go over where this module fits into the scheme of things.

Things to see:

* Getting Site-structure cloned with git.
* Get drupal 6 set up with correct database.
* Create a symbolic link to sites folder.
* Database includes site with alphabet feed view.
* See where/what Views Style plugin is/does.
* Learn how to get a current database using backup & migrate.
* Advanced: edit code & share it back to github (may require special authorization.)
* Drupal l() function.
* Views has theme functions.
* Module created theme functions can be overriden in site theme.
* Our theme has a base theme (it's just an extension of garland for now.)
* Default view.

What we need to build: 
* Theme output to use an icon set.
* Create another alphabet icon set.
* Create settings form in the view that allows user to chose the icon set.
* Make theme work with selected icon set.

Advanced Tasks
* Make a Views Summary handle Titles in the format
  * A is for
  * "A" is for

Problems that Chach needs to work on:
* Launch demo site.

* We need to separate out the theme function from the preprocess function.
Views should let us make a preprocess function if we provide it with a template.
This may be out of the scope of the class (at least for the next few weeks due to time.)
